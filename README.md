<h1 align="center"> OpenCV & OpenGL </h1> <br>




#### OpenCV Project:
This example focuses on showcasing the capabilities of the **OpenCV library**, which is widely used for computer vision tasks. The example specifically explores the topic of **object detection**, which involves identifying and locating objects within images or video streams. By studying the provided example, users can learn the fundamentals of object detection algorithms and understand how to implement them using OpenCV. The example includes practical exercises and code samples that allow users to gain hands-on experience in applying object detection techniques. By going through this example, users will acquire the necessary knowledge to leverage OpenCV for their own object detection projects.

#### OpenGL Project
The second example demonstrates the power of **OpenGL**, a graphics library used for rendering **2D** and **3D** graphics. This example focuses on creating a 3D globe using OpenGL. Users will learn the basics of OpenGL programming, including setting up the rendering environment, handling user input, and creating 3D models. By following along with the example, users will build a 3D globe that can be rotated and interacted with using various OpenGL techniques. This example serves as a practical foundation for individuals interested in utilizing OpenGL for 3D graphics programming. Users can apply the concepts learned in this example to create their own captivating 3D graphics projects.
